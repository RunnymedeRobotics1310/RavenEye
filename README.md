# Runnymede Robotics Team 1310 Raven Eye Strategy App

This is a FRC strategy app for Runnymede Robotics Team 1310. It is built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It 
communicates with the back-end, RavenBrain, via REST.

## Usage

The public URL for the app is https://raveneye.team1310.ca

For local developers, you can access the app at http://localhost:3000

Follow the instructions on the app.

## Development

This app is built as a single-page application using React, TypeScript, and Vite. To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   2. You'll need an IDE (we recommend IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate - free student licenses available). This will include a copy of git.
   3. You'll need a current copy of Node. You can install it directly or use a version manager.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
5. Make changes to the code and see them reflected in the browser
6. Run `npm run build` to build the app for production
7. Start up [RavenBrain](https://github.com/runnymederobotics1310/ravenbrain). RavenBrain is the back-end for RavenEye.
   8. If you haven't already installed RavenBrain, follow through the steps in the RavenBrain readme.

## To Do List

- The 2025 (Reefscape) version of the app was very game-specific. For 2026, the front-end will be replaced with more generic features
